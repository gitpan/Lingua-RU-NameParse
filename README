NameParse version 0.01
======================

This module converts Russian names in the form 
NAME PATRONYMIC to the nominative case.  Russian has seven cases;
names can appear in any of the seven cases in Russian texts, and the
point of the module is to serve as an aid in normalization.

Note that it is not always possible to determine the case of a 
word just by looking at the endings, especially with foreign names.
